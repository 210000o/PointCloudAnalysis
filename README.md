# PointCloudAnalysis
This Project is built for analyze Could Point Diagram generated by autopilot Radar components

Performing such a graph analysis is a difficult operation. If the distance limit between points and planes is not well grasped, it may cause: 1. The plane includes disconnected points; 2. The area of the plane is too small.

In order to get the best data, I conducted three experiments and tested the effect of different parameters on the number of result points and execution time in these experiments: 1, eps=0.01, possibility=0.1; 2, eps=0.1, possibility=0.1; 3, eps=0.01, possibility=0.2.

The time spent in Experiment 1 is the longest among the three experiments, and the points of the main plane are partially missing.

In Experiment 2, the time to find the first main plane was the same as in Experiment 1, but the time required to start from the second plane was greatly reduced. The reason is that the largest plane is successfully found and removed, which greatly reduces the amount of subsequent calculations.

Experiment 3 took the least time, almost one-tenth of the time spent in Experiment 1, but the plane found in Experiment 3 was too small and too useless.

In summary, the parameters of Experiment 2 (epse=0.1, possibility=0.1) can achieve the best results.
